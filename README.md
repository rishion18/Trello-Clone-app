This is a simple Trello or Kanban board clone app made using MERN stack.
For the Drag and Drop feature - I have used the React beautiful DND library.
How to use - 
you can create a new list by clicking on add a new list 
You can add specific tasks to specific lists and you can manage tasks by Dragging and Dropping in your desired lists.
